# PEP585 Upgrade

This is a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook configured to automatically upgrade your type hints
to the new native types implemented in [PEP 585](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/).

This will work for any Python version above `3.7`, though if you're not using `3.9` you will need to run the hook with `futures-imports=true`.

A complete type list is shown below.

### I'm a visual learner

In a nutshell, this code

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set, FrozenSet

def do_thing(x: List[Tuple[str, ...]], y: Dict[str, Set[str]]) -> FrozenSet:
```

becomes this

```python
def do_thing(x: list[tuple[str, ...]], y: dict[str, set[str]]) -> frozenset:
```

or this, if you're running python < 3.9 or enable the futures option

```python
from __future__ import annotations

def do_thing(x: list[tuple[str, ...]], y: dict[str, set[str]]) -> frozenset:
```

### Features:
- [x] Performs in-line substitution for new types
- [x] Adds new imports for upgrade types which need them
- [x] Adds `__futures__` imports if the futures flag is enabled
- [x] Removes no longer needed typing imports

Note: even though we remove and add imports *reasonably* well, I would
recommend running this in tandem with hooks like `isort` to aggregate
and sort your imports, and flake8 to discover any unused imports neither were able to remove.
Otherwise you risk needing to do *some* manual cleanup
from time to time (though it should be pretty rare).

### Config

To use this with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), simply add this to your config file:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/sondrelg/pep585-upgrade
  rev: ''  # Use the sha / tag you want to point at
  hooks:
  - id: upgrade-type-hints
```

and while futures imports are added automatically, you
can also enable them by adding a `--futures` arg:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/sondrelg/pep585-upgrade
  rev: ''  # Use the sha / tag you want to point at
  hooks:
  - id: upgrade-type-hints
    args: [ '--futures=true' ]
```

For more information about available arguments, see the [function definitions](https://github.com/sondrelg/pep585-upgrade/blob/master/src/upgrade_type_hints/update.py#L95).

### Running this once on my codebase

If you wish to run this once on your codebase, that's not easy to do *without* pre-commit, as it piggybacks on that process quite a bit.

However, installing pre-commit and configuring the hook to run will take you less than a minute. These are the steps:

- Run `pip install pre-commit`
- Run `touch pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Copy the configuration shown above into the file
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files`

### Running this once on a single file

To run the upgrade on a single file, you can clone the repo
and run `python -m upgrade_type_hints <filename>` from the src folder, or
something equivalent.

### Known imperfections

- We have a hard time removing common `import typing` imports, since we don't have a full inventory of all possible places `typing` could be used. Seeing something like this, you might think this is easy to handle

    ```python
    import typing

    x: typing.List
    ```

    but extending this example to a thousand-line file, the way we've structured the logic, there is no way to know whether there is a valid `typing.Optional` somewhere in the file.
- We might remove typing imports in a file where you needed them for more than just type annotations.
  An example of this is custom type declarations:

    ```python
    from typing import List

    x: List  # this will be upgraded and the import will be removed
    y = List[str]  # this will be left without its required import
    ```

  The reason for this is that custom type declarations are not a part
  of the `ast` objects we look at.

Both points are resolved by running flake8.
